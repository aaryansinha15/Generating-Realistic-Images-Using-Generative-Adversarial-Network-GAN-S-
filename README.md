# Generating-Realistic-Images-Using-Generative-Adversarial-Network-GAN-S-
A system created for generating real images through an adversarial process.
Firstly we created one model that is used to create fake images of 128-bit size. But the thing is that we want to compare the models of different image sizes which is why we have created two different models and also we have used two different GPUs T4x2 and P100. 
The T4x2 GPU is used for 128-bit size model creation and P100 GPU is used for 64-bit size model creation.
Along with that we have created codes for graphs separately.
